Feature: Create permissions for Experts
  In order to protect node creation
  As a Expert
  I want to test CRUD

  Background: Create nodes and users

    Given "circle" content:
    | title    | author  |
    | Avengers | admin   |

    Given "corporate" content:
    | title                 | author  |
    | Marvel Studios        | admin   |

    Given users:
    | name    | mail                            | roles    | field_first_name | field_last_name | field_address:mobile_number | field_education  | og_user_node | field_mail                      | field_entreprise     | field_working_status | field_domaine | field_address:country | field_notification_frequency |
    | expert1 | emindhub.test+expert1@gmail.com | expert   | Iron             | MAN             | 0712345670                  | Chieur g√©nial      | Avengers  | emindhub.test+expert1@gmail.com | Marvel Studios       | Employee             | Energy          | US                  | Real-time                    |

    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    When I go to "content/avengers"
      And I click "Administrate" in the "primary tabs" region
      And I click "People" in the "content" region
      And I click "Member since"
      # Twice for correct order
      And I click "Member since"
      And I click "edit" in the "Iron MAN" row
      And I select "Member" from "Status"
      And I press "Update membership"
    Then I should see "The membership has been updated."

  Scenario: Experts cannot create requests in circles they're not members
    Given I am logged in as "expert1"
    When I go to "node/add/request"
    Then I should see "Create Request"
      And I should see "Avengers"
      And I should not see "X-Men"

    #DONE Nasty bug : this line should not be necessary !!!!
      And the user expert1 has "edit own webform submissions" permission
      And the user expert1 has "create request content" permission
