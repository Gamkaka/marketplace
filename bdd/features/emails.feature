    # Make client1 as a Creator member of Avengers circle
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    When I go to "content/avengers"
      And I click "Group"
      And I click "People"
      And I click "Member since"
      # Twice for correct order
      And I click "Member since"
      And I click "edit" in the "Captain AMERICA" row
      # TODO nasty bug, on "Update membership" there is a redirection with an encoded "?redirect=xxx"
      # that provoques an error visible on watchdog ONLY with a "Then I break"
      # 2nd bug : It is not displayed by @wathdog at the end of the test
      And I go to stripped URL
      And I select "Active" from "Status"
      And I check the box "Creator member"
      And I press "Update membership"
      #Then I break   #to see the error go to watchdog
      # Again...
    When I go to "content/avengers"
      And I click "Group"
      And I click "People"
      And I click "Member since"
      # Twice for correct order
      And I click "Member since"
    Then I should see "Creator member" in the "Captain AMERICA" row
    When I click "edit" in the "Iron MAN" row
      And I go to stripped URL
      And I select "Active" from "Status"
      And I press "Update membership"
    Then I should see "The membership has been updated."
    When I go to "content/avengers"

      And I go to stripped URL
      And I select "Active" from "Status"
      And I press "Update membership"
    Then I should see "The membership has been updated."
    Given the test email system is enabled

  Scenario: Experts are notified by email for new request publication
    Given "request" content:
    | title                       | field_domaine | og_group_ref    | author  | field_expiration_date  | status  |

    When I run cron
    #DONT FORGET : drush @dev rules-enable rules_emh_request_send_notification_email 
    Then  the last email to "emindhub.test+expert1@gmail.com" should contain "Dear Iron,"
      And the email should contain "A new request for expertise has been published on eMindHub"
      And the last email to "emindhub.test+expert2@gmail.com" should contain "Dear Black,"
      And the email should contain "A new request for expertise has been published on eMindHub"
      And the last email to "emindhub.test+client1@gmail.com" should not contain "published"
