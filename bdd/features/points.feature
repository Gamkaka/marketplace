    | expert2 | expert2@emindhub.com | expert   | Klark            | Kent            |
    Given I give "client1" 300 emh points
    Given "question1" content:

    | What about ? | Energy        | All experts  | 100          | client1 |

  Scenario: respond from an expert
    Then I should have 100 points on "What about ?" node

    Given I am logged in as "expert1"

    When I click "What about ?" in the "What about ?" row
    Then I enter "Je suis un expert" for "Public response"
    And I press "Publish"

    And I press "Publish"

    Given I am logged in as "client1"
    When I go to "content/my-responses"
    Then I should see "expert1"
    And I should see "expert2"
    #Then node "What about ?" transfers 50 points on "expert1" user
    #Then node "What about ?" transfers 50 points on "expert2" user
    When I go to "homepage"
    And I click "What about ?" in the "What about ?" row
    Then I break

    And I click "Arrange points"
    #Then I should see the success message( containing) "Arranged" 
    Then I should have 0 points on "What about ?" node

    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    When I go to "admin/emindhub/points/transaction-log"
    Then I should see "Move points from Captain America to question1 What about ?."
