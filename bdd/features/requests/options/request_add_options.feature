    Given I give "client1" 10000 emh credits

    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    When I go to "content/avengers"
      And I click "Group"
      And I click "People"
      And I click "edit" in the "Captain AMERICA" row
      And I select "Active" from "Status"
      And I press "Update membership"
    Then I should see "Active" in the "Captain AMERICA" row

  Scenario: An author can add an option on a draft request and come back to test it's readonly after publish
    Given I am logged in as "client1"
    When I go to "requests/manage"
    Then I should see "Avengers" in the "How to become a superhero?" row

    When I click "How to become a superhero?" in the "How to become a superhero?" row
      And I click "Edit" in the "primary tabs" region
      And I check the box "Duration"
    Then I should see "Duration of the mission"
      And I should see "Desired starting date"
      And I fill in "Duration of the mission" with "1 month"

    When I press "Continue"
    # Validation page
      And I press "Publish"
    Then I should see "Request How to become a superhero? has been published."
      And I should see "1 month"

    When I click "Edit" in the "primary tabs" region
    Then the "Duration" checkbox should be checked

    #TODO : Not the best way to test, but right now, no "readonly" test exists
    When I check the box "Duration"
    Then the "Duration" checkbox should be checked

  Scenario: An author can add an option in request creation
    Given I am logged in as "client1"
    When I go to "node/add/request"
      And I click "Mission" in the "request_type" region
